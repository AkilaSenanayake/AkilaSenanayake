# 📝 What Drives Me:

I am driven by a desire to solve real-world problems through technology. My experiences in software engineering and social media consulting have provided me with the versatility to approach challenges creatively and effectively. Currently diving deep into the world of software testing, with a sharp eye for detail and a passion for making sure things just work as they should.
